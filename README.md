# Nikita Deshpande - Data Science & Analysis • AI
## About
✨Hi, I'm Nikita Deshpande, a final - year student at the University of Birmingham. 

Currently perusing my integrated Masters [MEng] Computer Science and Software Engineering degree, I am experienced in the different fields of computer science, such as: 
- UI/UX design: where I led a team in producing a user-centric solution from scratch, incorporating tools like Figma, conducted interviews and a range of primary and secondary research and pitched my findings.
- Full Stack Web Development: where I practiced leadership and agile project development, incorporating CI/CD alongside taking responsibility for frontend solutions.
- Software Life Cycle Development and Security and Networks and Security of Real – World Systems where I was introduced to the current cyber-attacks and its mitigations.
- IoT Development, where I designed an IoT based smart shopping system, incorporating stakeholder analysis, hi-fi mobile prototypes, architecture diagrams, learning and deployment and a holistic evaluation.
Aside from these, I have studied OOP, and other such functional programming tools alongside a range of AI and CS modules. 

Currently, I am working on a Natural Language Processing with Data Mining and Analysis Project. Currently, I am working independently in producing ML and Data Analysis driven projects such as: SMS spam detection, Credit Card flaw detection and Movie Sentiment Analysis.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant, aiding in the research of technological advancements globally and its potential impact across different sectors. Similarly, due to my keen interest in the business sector, I have been involved as a Business Analyst, investigating, through several factors such as: interviews, surveys, SWOT analysis, break-even analysis, the impact of certain motivational theories on the annual revenue and intrinsic/ extrinsic motivation of ABB employers and reporting the findings. 

Due to my experiences, I have learned to work alongside various people, especially people of varying ideologies, work patterns and have learned to lead teams under varying conditions and have proven to produce high-quality results.

In my free time, you'd find me curled up with a good book, or binge-watching TV shows! Badminton, music and travelling also diverts my mind!✨
